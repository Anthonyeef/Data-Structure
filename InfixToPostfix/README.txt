Here is the program to generate postfix from infix. Comments as instruction are included inside to explain every single code. But honestly the idea is from the professor's lide and the textbook page 164.

Attention:
- Only support operator : +, -, *, /, %;
- Operand can only be : 'a' ~ 'z' and 'A' ~ 'Z';

The source code is the file name 'main.cpp'. I use Intellij's C&C++ IDE Clion for coding, so there is one additional file call CMakeLists. It's for the IDE compiler only and I have also compiled this program under g++, the execute file is named InfixToPostfix.

Feel free to contact me if you have any question.
